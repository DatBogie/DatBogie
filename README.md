## Hello there!
I'm Dat Bogie, a young programmer from the US.
<br>He/him, heteroromantic bisexual.
<br>FYI, my pfp is a pic of my dog (I have two of them and they are the best)!

## Programming
I've been programming from a fairly young age, starting off with Roblox Studio, then Scratch, then taking my first Computer Science course in my freshman year.
<br>I've picked up Lua(_u_), Python and JavaScript so far, and will hopefully learn some more soon!
